    <p>I wake up early in the morning and start my day with a cup of tea. After that, I go for a short walk.</p>
    <p>Once I return home, I study programming and practice HTML. Learning web development is fun and helps me build
        creative projects.</p>
    <p>In the evening, I exercise and spend time with my family before going to bed.</p>


    <!-- tips
    
    * Always wrap normal sentences inside <p> ... </p>.
    * Avoid putting multiple paragraphs inside one <p> — use separate tags instead.
    * You can use inline tags inside paragraphs, e.g.
        <strong> for bold → <strong>important</strong>
            <em> for italic → <em>word</em> -->

    <p>This is <strong>important</strong> and <em>interesting</em> information.</p>
